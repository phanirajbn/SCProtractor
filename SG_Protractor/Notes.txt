Protractor is based on JS and performs various features using ES5 and ES6.
JS programming language is maintained thro stds defined by ECMA. 
Javascript:
Simplified programming language. Runs only in a browser..
The code of Js is placed within the HTML tags. U need an interpretor to interpret the code of the JS and generate the required DOM structure. 
JS contains lot of global functions that can be used for UR Application UI interaction. alert, Prompt and confirm functions helps in interacting with the user using UI elements.  
There are many such global functions that can be used for developing dynamic pages in JS....

U create functions in JS if U want to semantically group a set of statements for better modularity. If those statements are repeatedly used in UR Program, u could make it as a function.
